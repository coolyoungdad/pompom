# PomPom v2.0 Pre-Deployment Checklist
## 60/30/9/1 Probability Distribution Release

**Print this page and check off each item before deploying.**

---

## ⚠️ STOP - READ THIS FIRST

This deployment changes core game mechanics. **Do not skip any step.**

**What's changing:**
- Drop rates: 70.5/25/4/0.5 → 60/30/9/1
- Buyback prices: Lower across all tiers
- Profit per box: $8.19 → $7.47 (-$0.72)
- User experience: +35% better (more rare/ultra pulls)

**Approval:** 3-1 vote (CEO/Designer/Data Scientist approved, CFO cautioned)

---

## PHASE 1: INVENTORY & CASH (DO FIRST)

### Critical Inventory Purchase
**Status:** ⬜ NOT STARTED | ⬜ IN PROGRESS | ⬜ COMPLETE

**Why:** Current rare stock (25 units) only supports 278 boxes at new 9% drop rate. Without restocking, you'll run out in 2-3 weeks.

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Order **+65 rare items** minimum
- [ ] Budget confirmed: **$3,900** (secondary market pricing)
- [ ] Sourcing plan:
  - [ ] Option 1: PopMart stores (retail ~$15-20/unit, need bulk)
  - [ ] Option 2: Secondary market (eBay, Mercari, ~$60/unit)
  - [ ] Option 3: Authorized distributor (best if available)
- [ ] Storage plan: Store at home, organize by rarity
- [ ] ETA for delivery: _______________ (date)

**Additional Optional Stock:**
- [ ] +170 uncommon items ($2,550) for 1,000 box capacity
- [ ] +5 ultra items ($750) for buffer
- [ ] Total investment if ordering all: **$7,200**

**Timeline:**
- Order rare items **within 48 hours** of deployment
- Can deploy before items arrive (278 boxes buffer)
- Cannot sustain 100 boxes/month beyond Week 3 without rare restock

---

### Cash Reserve Confirmation
**Status:** ⬜ NOT STARTED | ⬜ COMPLETE

- [ ] Bank account balance ≥ **$3,000**
- [ ] Purpose: Covers ultra sellback variance (worst case: 3 ultras in one month = $240 cost)
- [ ] Operating buffer: Do not dip below **$2,000** at any time

**If balance < $3,000:**
- [ ] Option 1: Delay deployment until cash available
- [ ] Option 2: Reduce to 65/28/6/1 distribution (safer margin)
- [ ] Option 3: Proceed with risk (monitor daily, kill switch ready)

---

## PHASE 2: DATABASE MIGRATIONS

### Migration 007: Sellback Inventory + Shipping
**Status:** ⬜ NOT STARTED | ⬜ COMPLETE

**File:** `pompom/supabase/migrations/007_sellback_inventory_restore.sql`

**Steps:**
1. [ ] Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. [ ] Open `007_sellback_inventory_restore.sql` in code editor
3. [ ] Copy entire file contents
4. [ ] Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
5. [ ] Click **"Run"**

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Run this query to verify success:
SELECT routine_name, updated
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_name = 'sellback_item';

-- Should return 1 row with recent updated timestamp
```

- [ ] Verification query returned success
- [ ] No error messages in Supabase logs

**What this does:**
- ✅ Fixes sellback inventory restoration bug

### Migration 008: Probability Distribution Update
**Status:** ⬜ NOT STARTED | ⬜ COMPLETE

**Steps:**
1. [ ] Confirm migration 007 completed successfully
2. [ ] Open new query in Supabase SQL Editor
3. [ ] Open `008_update_probabilities_60_30_9_1.sql` in code editor
4. [ ] Copy entire file contents
5. [ ] Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
6. [ ] Click **"Run"**
7. [ ] Wait for success message (should take <5 seconds)

**Verification (Optional - takes 30 seconds):**
Run the included test query to verify distribution is correct:
```sql
-- This runs 1,000 test box opens and counts rarities
-- (Full query is at bottom of migration file)
-- Expected: Common ~600, Uncommon ~300, Rare ~90, Ultra ~10
```

- [ ] Verification query showed correct distribution
- [ ] No error messages in Supabase logs

**What this does:**
