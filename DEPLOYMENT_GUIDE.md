# PomPom Deployment Guide
## 60/30/9/1 Probability Distribution Release

**Date:** February 18, 2026
**Version:** 2.0 (Major update)
**Status:** Ready for Production Deployment

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This deployment implements the approved 60/30/9/1 probability distribution with:
- **Financial Impact:** -$72/month profit at 100 boxes/month (acceptable for growth stage)
- **User Experience:** +35% improvement in "win" rate (uncommon or better)
- **Viral Potential:** 2x more ultra pulls, 2.3x more rare pulls
- **Business Risk:** MEDIUM (requires inventory investment + cash buffer)
- **Technical Risk:** LOW (all changes tested, rollback plan included)

**Executive Approval:** 3-1 vote (CEO, Game Designer, Data Scientist approved; CFO cautioned)

---

## PRE-DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS

### ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO NOT DEPLOY WITHOUT THESE:

1. **Inventory Investment:** Order +65 rare items ($3,900 budget)
   - Current rare stock: 25 units
   - New rare probability: 9% (was 4%)
   - Bottleneck: Only 278 boxes supported with current stock
   - **Order before deploying** or you'll run out in 2-3 weeks at 100 boxes/month

2. **Cash Reserve:** Verify $3,000 minimum in bank account
   - Covers ultra variance (worst case: 3 ultras in one month = $240 sellback cost)
   - Provides buffer for unexpected sellback spikes

3. **Database Migrations:** Run both SQL migrations in Supabase
   - Migration 007: Sellback inventory restoration + shipping fees
   - Migration 008: Probability distribution update
   - **Must run 007 before 008** (sequential dependency)

4. **Google Sheet:** Update financial model with new projections
   - Use data from `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_60_30_9_1.txt`
   - Track actual vs projected metrics weekly

---

## DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### PHASE 1: DATABASE UPDATES (30 minutes)

**Step 1.1: Run Migration 007 (Sellback Inventory Restoration)**

```bash
# Location: pompom/supabase/migrations/007_sellback_inventory_restore.sql
```

1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy entire contents of `007_sellback_inventory_restore.sql`
3. Paste and click "Run"
4. Verify success with test query:

```sql
-- Should return updated_at timestamp
SELECT routine_name, updated
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_name = 'sellback_item';

-- Should show shipping_fee and tracking_number columns
SELECT column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'user_inventory'
  AND column_name IN ('shipping_fee', 'tracking_number');

-- Should return the view
SELECT * FROM low_inventory_items LIMIT 5;
```

**What This Migration Does:**
- ✅ Fixes critical bug: sold-back items now restore to inventory
- ✅ Adds shipping_fee column to user_inventory
- ✅ Adds tracking_number column for fulfillment
- ✅ Creates low_inventory_items view for admin alerts

---

**Step 1.2: Run Migration 008 (Probability Update)**

```bash
# Location: pompom/supabase/migrations/008_update_probabilities_60_30_9_1.sql
```

1. In Supabase SQL Editor, open new query
2. Copy entire contents of `008_update_probabilities_60_30_9_1.sql`
3. Paste and click "Run"
4. Verify success with test query:

```sql
-- Test the updated probability distribution
SELECT open_mystery_box('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000');
-- Run 100 times and check distribution is roughly 60/30/9/1

-- Or use the included verification query from migration file
DO $$
DECLARE
  v_common_count INT := 0;
  v_uncommon_count INT := 0;
  v_rare_count INT := 0;
  v_ultra_count INT := 0;
  v_result RECORD;
  i INT;
BEGIN
  FOR i IN 1..1000 LOOP
    SELECT * INTO v_result FROM open_mystery_box('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000');
    CASE v_result.rarity
      WHEN 'common' THEN v_common_count := v_common_count + 1;
      WHEN 'uncommon' THEN v_uncommon_count := v_uncommon_count + 1;
      WHEN 'rare' THEN v_rare_count := v_rare_count + 1;
      WHEN 'ultra' THEN v_ultra_count := v_ultra_count + 1;
    END CASE;
  END LOOP;

  RAISE NOTICE 'Common: % (target: 600)', v_common_count;
  RAISE NOTICE 'Uncommon: % (target: 300)', v_uncommon_count;
  RAISE NOTICE 'Rare: % (target: 90)', v_rare_count;
  RAISE NOTICE 'Ultra: % (target: 10)', v_ultra_count;
END $$;
```

**Expected Output:**
- Common: ~600 (60%)
- Uncommon: ~300 (30%)
- Rare: ~90 (9%)
- Ultra: ~10 (1%)

**What This Migration Does:**
- ✅ Updates `open_mystery_box()` function to 60/30/9/1 distribution
- ✅ Updates `open_mystery_box_with_exclusions()` (shake feature) to same distribution
- ✅ Includes pity system table structure (commented out, ready for Phase 2)

   ```

4. **Click Deploy**

   - Wait 2-5 minutes for build to complete
   - Copy your production URL (e.g., `https://pompom.vercel.app`)

---

**Step 2.3: Update Supabase Auth URLs**

1. Open Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration
2. Add your Vercel URL to **Site URL**: `https://pompom.vercel.app`
3. Add to **Redirect URLs**:
   - `https://pompom.vercel.app/auth/callback`
   - `https://pompom.vercel.app/**` (wildcard for all routes)
4. Click "Save"

---

**Step 2.4: Configure Stripe Webhook for Production**

1. Open Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Endpoint URL: `https://pompom.vercel.app/api/webhooks/stripe`
4. Events to send: Select **checkout.session.completed**
5. Click "Add endpoint"
6. Copy the **Signing secret** (starts with `whsec_...`)
7. Go back to Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables
8. Update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` with the new production signing secret
9. Redeploy (Vercel → Deployments → ••• → Redeploy)

---

**Step 2.5: Test Production Deployment**

**Full User Flow Test:**

1. **Sign Up**
   - Visit `https://pompom.vercel.app`
   - Create new account with test email
   - Verify email works, redirects to /box

2. **Top Up Balance**
   - Click "Top Up Balance" → $25 option
   - Use Stripe test card in **LIVE mode**: Contact Stripe support for test mode in production, OR use a real card for $0.50 test
   - Verify webhook processes (check Supabase `balance_transactions` table)
   - Verify balance updates in UI

3. **Open Mystery Box**
   - Click "Open Mystery Box"
   - Verify animation works
   - Check rarity distribution (should see more uncommons than before)
   - Verify balance deducts $25

4. **Shake Feature**
   - Before opening, click "Shake Box" ($1.49)
   - Verify exclusions work
   - Verify can only shake once per box

5. **Sellback Item**
   - Click "Sell Back" on revealed item
   - Verify balance credits correctly
   - **CRITICAL CHECK:** Go to Supabase → `inventory` table → verify `quantity_available` increased by 1
   - This confirms migration 007 worked

6. **Request Shipping**
   - Keep an item, click "Ship Item"
   - Fill out address form
   - Verify shipping fee logic:
     - If balance < $50: Should charge $5
     - If balance ≥ $50: Should be free
   - Check admin dashboard → should see shipping request

7. **Admin Dashboard** (if you have admin role)
   - Visit `/admin`
   - Verify InventoryAlerts component loads
   - Check low inventory warnings (should see alerts if rare items < 20)

**What to Watch For:**
- ⚠️ Any console errors in browser DevTools
- ⚠️ Any failed API calls in Network tab
- ⚠️ Balance not updating after top-up (webhook issue)
- ⚠️ Inventory not restoring after sellback (migration 007 didn't run)

---

### PHASE 3: POST-DEPLOYMENT MONITORING (Ongoing)

**Step 3.1: Set Up Daily Monitoring**

Create a simple spreadsheet (or use your Google Sheet) to track these daily for first 30 days:

| Date | Boxes Opened | Revenue | Sellback Rate | Rare Pulls | Ultra Pulls | Low Inventory Items |
|------|-------------|---------|---------------|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 2/18 | 5 | $125 | 60% | 0 | 0 | 3 items |
| 2/19 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Step 3.2: Inventory Alerts**

Check `/admin` dashboard **every morning** for low inventory warnings:
- **CRITICAL (<5 units)**: Restock immediately
- **WARNING (5-9 units)**: Order within 3 days
- **LOW (10-19 units)**: Plan restocking this week

**Step 3.3: Financial Metrics (Weekly)**

Track these weekly in your Google Sheet:

```
Week 1 Actual vs Projected:
- Boxes opened: ___ (target: 25)
- Revenue: $___ (target: $625)
- Avg profit/box: $___ (target: $7.47)
- Blended sellback rate: ___% (target: <45%)
- Ultra sellback rate: ___% (target: 20-40%)
```

**Step 3.4: Kill Switch Criteria**

**STOP THE EXPERIMENT IMMEDIATELY IF:**
- Sellback rate exceeds **48%** (margin too thin)
- Revenue per user drops **below control group**
- You run out of rare items (inventory depleted)
- Cash balance drops below **$2,000** (unable to cover sellbacks)

**How to Revert (Emergency Rollback):**

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, run the rollback from migration 008:
-- (Full rollback script is at bottom of 008_update_probabilities_60_30_9_1.sql)

-- Quick version:
UPDATE public.products SET
  buyback_price = CASE rarity
    WHEN 'common' THEN 8.00
    WHEN 'uncommon' THEN 25.00
    WHEN 'rare' THEN 50.00
    WHEN 'ultra' THEN 100.00
  END
WHERE rarity IN ('common', 'uncommon', 'rare', 'ultra');

-- Then redeploy with old probability thresholds (0.005, 0.045, 0.295)
```

## RISK MITIGATION CHECKLIST

### Financial Risks

- [ ] **Rare inventory ordered** (+65 units, $3,900 budget)
  - Source: PopMart stores, secondary market (eBay, Mercari)
  - Timeline: Order within 48 hours of deployment
  - Storage: Keep at home, organize by rarity

- [ ] **Cash reserve confirmed** ($3,000 minimum in bank)
  - Covers worst-case ultra variance
  - Do not dip below $2,000 operating buffer

- [ ] **Stripe fees budgeted** (2.9% + $0.30 per transaction)
  - At $25 topup: Stripe keeps $1.03, you get $23.97
  - At 100 boxes/month: ~$100-120/month in Stripe fees

### Operational Risks

- [ ] **Admin dashboard access confirmed**
  - Run: `UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your@email.com';` in Supabase
  - Test: Visit `/admin` and verify InventoryAlerts loads

- [ ] **Shipping workflow documented**
  - When user requests shipping: Check admin dashboard
  - Create label manually via USPS.com
  - Mark as shipped in admin panel (Phase 2 feature - manual for now)

- [ ] **Customer support email set up**
  - Create support@pompom.com (or use personal email initially)
  - Response time target: 24 hours
  - Common issues: "Balance didn't update", "Where's my item?"

### Technical Risks

- [ ] **Error monitoring set up** (Sentry or similar)
  - Optional but recommended
  - Catches production errors before users report them

- [ ] **Backup plan confirmed**
  - Supabase auto-backups enabled (daily)
  - Download manual backup before deployment: Supabase → Database → Backups

- [ ] **Rate limiting configured** (Upstash Redis)
  - Optional but recommended
  - Prevents abuse of box opening API

---

## SUCCESS METRICS (30-Day A/B Test)

### Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

**After 30 days, FULL ROLLOUT if:**
- ✅ Revenue per user ≥ control group
- ✅ Viral coefficient increases 25%+ (more social shares)
- ✅ 7-day retention improves 10%+
- ✅ Sellback rate stays < 45%
- ✅ Customer feedback positive (NPS > 40)

**After 30 days, REVERT to 65/28/6/1 if:**
- ❌ Revenue per user < control group
- ❌ Sellback rate > 48%
- ❌ No improvement in CAC (customer acquisition cost)
- ❌ Negative customer feedback (excessive sellbacks, feels rigged)

**Metrics to Track Weekly:**
1. Revenue per user (RPU)
2. Boxes opened per user
3. Sellback rate by rarity (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Ultra)
4. Shake adoption rate (% who pay $1.49)
5. Shipping request rate (% who keep items)
6. Viral shares (track manually via social media mentions)
7. 7-day retention rate
8. 30-day retention rate
9. Customer support tickets (volume + common issues)
10. Inventory depletion rate (days until restock needed)

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Balance doesn't update after Stripe payment

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks → webhook endpoint
2. Click on recent event → View logs
3. Look for errors

**Common Causes:**
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` mismatch (dev vs production)
- Webhook not configured for production URL
- `credit_user_balance` SQL function doesn't exist

**Fix:**
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, verify function exists:
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines WHERE routine_name = 'credit_user_balance';

# If missing, run the function creation from migration 007
```

---

### Issue: Sellback doesn't restore inventory

**Diagnosis:**
Check Supabase logs for errors in `sellback_item` function

**Fix:**
Migration 007 must be run. Verify with:

```sql
-- Should show quantity increased after sellback
SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE product_id = 'some-product-id';
```

---

### Issue: Admin dashboard shows 0 inventory alerts (but I know items are low)

**Diagnosis:**
`low_inventory_items` view doesn't exist

**Fix:**
Run migration 007 (includes view creation)

---

### Issue: Shipping fee always charges $5 (even with $50+ balance)

**Diagnosis:**
Code logic error or old deployment

**Fix:**
1. Check Vercel → Deployments → ensure latest deployment is active
2. Verify `app/api/shipping/request/route.ts` has correct logic:
   ```typescript
   const shippingFee = currentBalance >= 50 ? 0 : 5.00;
   ```

---

## ROLLBACK PLAN

If you need to revert everything:

**Step 1: Database Rollback**

See `pompom/supabase/migrations/008_update_probabilities_60_30_9_1.sql` bottom section for full SQL rollback script.

**Step 2: Code Rollback**

```bash
# Revert to commit before this deployment
git log --oneline  # Find the commit hash before "Deploy v2.0"
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main

# Vercel will auto-deploy the reverted code
```

**Step 3: Notify Users (if needed)**

If users were affected:
- Send email: "We've temporarily adjusted our box odds while we improve the experience"
- Offer $5 credit to affected users as goodwill

---
