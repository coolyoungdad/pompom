## WEEKLY TRACKING (Every Monday)

### Data Collection

**From Supabase (run these queries in SQL Editor):**

```sql
-- Total boxes opened this week
SELECT COUNT(*) as boxes_opened
FROM balance_transactions
WHERE type = 'box_purchase'
  AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';

### Weekly Analysis

**Answer these questions every Monday:**

1. **Are we on track financially?**
   - Actual profit/box: $_____ (target: $7.47)
   - **If < $6.50:** Investigate sellback rate, may need intervention
   - **If > $8.50:** Users keeping more items than expected (good!)

2. **Is the probability distribution working correctly?**
   - Common: ____% (target: 60% ± 5%)

3. **What's the sellback rate by rarity?**
   ```sql
   -- Run this query:
   SELECT
     ui.rarity,
     COUNT(*) as total_items,

## KILL SWITCH MONITORING

### Check These Thresholds WEEKLY

**🔴 STOP IMMEDIATELY AND ROLLBACK IF:**

| Metric | Kill Threshold | Current Value | Status |
|--------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| Sellback rate (blended) | > 48% | ____% | ⬜ OK / ⬜ KILL |
| Revenue per user | < Control group | $____ | ⬜ OK / ⬜ KILL |
| Rare inventory | < 5 items | ____ items | ⬜ OK / ⬜ KILL |
| Cash balance | < $2,000 | $____ | ⬜ OK / ⬜ KILL |
| Profit per box | < $5.00 | $____ | ⬜ OK / ⬜ KILL |

**If ANY threshold triggered:**
1. Stop accepting new box opens (disable "Open Box" button temporarily)
2. Run rollback procedure (see DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
3. Communicate to users via email
4. Analyze root cause before re-deploying

---

### Blended Sellback Rate Calculation

```sql
-- Calculate weighted sellback rate
WITH sellback_stats AS (
  SELECT
    ui.rarity,
    COUNT(*) as total,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ui.status = 'sold' THEN 1 END) as sold,
    CASE ui.rarity
      WHEN 'common' THEN 0.60
      WHEN 'uncommon' THEN 0.30
      WHEN 'rare' THEN 0.09
      WHEN 'ultra' THEN 0.01
    END as probability
  FROM user_inventory ui
  WHERE ui.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
  GROUP BY ui.rarity
)
SELECT
  SUM(
    (sold::DECIMAL / NULLIF(total, 0)) * probability
  ) / SUM(probability) * 100 as blended_sellback_pct
FROM sellback_stats;
```

**Target:** < 45%
**Warning:** > 45%
**Kill:** > 48%

## 30-DAY GO/NO-GO DECISION

### Success Criteria (Full Rollout)

**Evaluate these metrics on Day 30:**

| Metric | Target | Actual | Met? |
|--------|--------|--------|------|
| Revenue per user | ≥ Control | $____ | ⬜ Yes / ⬜ No |
| Viral coefficient | +25% vs control | +____% | ⬜ Yes / ⬜ No |
| 7-day retention | +10% vs control | +____% | ⬜ Yes / ⬜ No |
| Sellback rate | < 45% | ____% | ⬜ Yes / ⬜ No |
| Customer satisfaction | NPS > 40 | NPS ____ | ⬜ Yes / ⬜ No |

**Decision Matrix:**

| Criteria Met | Decision |
|--------------|----------|
| 5/5 | ✅ **FULL ROLLOUT** - Keep 60/30/9/1, scale up |
| 4/5 | ✅ **CONTINUE** - Extend test 30 days, monitor closely |
| 3/5 | ⚠️ **ITERATE** - Adjust to 65/28/6/1 (compromise) |
| ≤2/5 | ❌ **REVERT** - Rollback to 70.5/25/4/0.5 |

---

### Viral Coefficient Tracking

**Manual tracking (no automated analytics yet):**

1. **Social Media Mentions**
   - Search Twitter for "pompom mystery box" weekly
   - Count unique mentions: _____
   - Track sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)
   - Note any viral posts (>1,000 likes)

2. **Referral Source**
   - Ask new users in welcome email: "How did you hear about us?"
   - Options: Friend, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, Other
   - Calculate: Friend referrals / Total signups = _____%

3. **UGC (User Generated Content)**
   - Count unboxing videos posted: _____
   - Count rare/ultra pull posts: _____
   - Compare to previous 30 days: +____% increase

**Viral Coefficient Formula:**
```
Viral Coefficient = (New users from referrals) / (Existing users who invited)

Target: 0.5+ (each user brings 0.5 new users = exponential growth)
Excellent: 1.0+ (each user brings 1+ new user = rapid growth)
```

---

### Retention Rate Calculation

```sql
-- 7-day retention
WITH cohort AS (
  SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('week', created_at) as signup_week,
    user_id
  FROM users
  WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '60 days'
),
activity AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT
    user_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('week', created_at) as activity_week
  FROM user_inventory
)
SELECT
  c.signup_week,
  COUNT(DISTINCT c.user_id) as signups,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE
    WHEN a.activity_week = c.signup_week + INTERVAL '1 week' THEN c.user_id
  END) as retained_week_1,
  ROUND(
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE
      WHEN a.activity_week = c.signup_week + INTERVAL '1 week' THEN c.user_id
    END) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT c.user_id),
    1
  ) as retention_pct
FROM cohort c
LEFT JOIN activity a ON c.user_id = a.user_id
GROUP BY c.signup_week
ORDER BY c.signup_week DESC
LIMIT 8;
```

**Benchmark:**
- Good: 30-40% week-1 retention
- Excellent: 50%+ week-1 retention
- Industry avg (gacha): 25-35%

## CUSTOMER SUPPORT TRACKING

### Support Ticket Template

**Track all customer issues in a simple spreadsheet:**

| Date | Issue Type | Description | Resolution | Time to Resolve |
|------|-----------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| 2/18 | Balance | Topup didn't credit | Checked webhook, manually credited | 2 hours |
| 2/19 | Shipping | Where's tracking? | Not shipped yet, sent ETA | 30 min |
| 2/20 | Rare pull | Got ultra, amazing! | Positive feedback, thanked user | 5 min |

**Common Issue Types:**
- Balance not updating
- Item never shipped
- Wrong item received
- "Feels rigged" / probability complaints
- How to sell back
- Account locked
- Positive feedback

**Weekly Analysis:**
- Most common issue: _____________________________
- Average resolution time: _____ hours
- % resolved within 24 hours: _____%
- Positive feedback count: _____

**Red flags:**
- >10 tickets/week at 100 boxes/month = issue with UX
- Multiple "rigged" complaints = perception problem
- Balance update issues = webhook broken

---

## INVENTORY MANAGEMENT

### Restock Triggers

**Automated alerts via Admin Dashboard, but also track manually:**

| Rarity | Current Stock | Weekly Burn Rate | Days Until Depletion | Action Needed |
|--------|---------------|------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Common | ___ | ___ | ___ | ⬜ Order / ⬜ OK |
| Uncommon | ___ | ___ | ___ | ⬜ Order / ⬜ OK |
| Rare | ___ | ___ | ___ | ⬜ Order / ⬜ OK |
| Ultra | ___ | ___ | ___ | ⬜ Order / ⬜ OK |

**Burn Rate Formula:**
```
Weekly Burn Rate = Boxes Opened This Week × Probability

Example:
- 100 boxes opened
- Rare probability: 9%
- Rare burn rate: 100 × 0.09 = 9 rare items used this week
```

**Days Until Depletion:**
```
Days Until Depletion = (Current Stock / Weekly Burn Rate) × 7

Example:
- Rare stock: 25 items
- Weekly burn rate: 9 items
- Days: (25 / 9) × 7 = 19.4 days
```

**Restock Levels:**
- Common: Restock when < 200 (order +300)
- Uncommon: Restock when < 50 (order +100)
- Rare: Restock when < 15 (order +50)
- Ultra: Restock when < 3 (order +10)

## FINANCIAL RECONCILIATION

### Monthly Audit (End of Month)

**Compare Actual vs Projected:**

| Metric | Projected | Actual | Variance | Analysis |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| Boxes opened | 100 | ___ | ___% | ________________________ |
| Revenue | $2,695 | $___ | ___% | ________________________ |
| COGS | $1,200 | $___ | ___% | ________________________ |
| Sellback cost | $748 | $___ | ___% | ________________________ |
| Gross profit | $747 | $___ | ___% | ________________________ |
| Margin | 27.7% | ___% | ___pp | ________________________ |

**Stripe Fees:**
```sql
-- Estimate Stripe fees (they don't appear in your DB)
SELECT
  SUM(amount) as total_topups,
  SUM(amount) * 0.029 + COUNT(*) * 0.30 as estimated_stripe_fees
FROM balance_transactions
WHERE type = 'topup'
  AND created_at >= DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW());
```

**Cash Reconciliation:**
```
Bank Balance = Opening Balance + Revenue - Inventory Purchases - Operating Expenses - Stripe Fees

Verify: Actual bank balance matches calculation ± $50
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Probability distribution looks off

**Symptoms:**
- Week 1: Common 75%, Uncommon 20%, Rare 4%, Ultra 1%
- Significantly off from 60/30/9/1 target

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check if migration 008 actually ran:
   ```sql
   SELECT routine_name, routine_definition
   FROM information_schema.routines
   WHERE routine_name = 'open_mystery_box';
   ```
2. Look for `v_rand < 0.01` (should be 0.01, not 0.005)
3. Look for `v_rand < 0.10` (should be 0.10, not 0.045)
4. Look for `v_rand < 0.40` (should be 0.40, not 0.295)

**Fix:**
- Re-run migration 008 if thresholds are wrong
- Clear Vercel cache: Vercel → Deployments → ••• → Redeploy

---

### Issue: Sellback rate too high (>48%)

**Symptoms:**
- Margin dropping below 20%
- Users selling back >48% of all items
- Ultra sellback rate >60%

**Root Causes:**
- Product selection poor (users don't want the items)
- Buyback prices too generous relative to perceived value
- Better deals available elsewhere

**Fix:**
1. **Immediate (Band-aid):**
   - Lower buyback prices slightly (Common $7 → $6, Uncommon $22 → $20)
   - Communicate as "updated market pricing"

2. **Medium-term (Product improvement):**
   - Survey users: "What items do you actually want?"
   - Replace unpopular products with high-demand collectibles
   - Test new products at lower quantities first

3. **Long-term (Structural):**
   - Implement tier-based sellback bonuses (Gold members get +$1)
   - Add "sell now vs keep for collection" messaging
   - Gamify keeping items (collection completion rewards)

---

### Issue: Inventory depleting faster than expected

**Symptoms:**
- Rare items down to 8 remaining (expected 15+)
- Only 2 weeks into deployment
- Admin dashboard showing CRITICAL alerts

**Root Cause:**
- More boxes opened than projected (growth!)
- Sellback rate lower than expected (users keeping items)

**Fix:**
1. **Immediate:**
   - Expedite rare item order (priority shipping)
   - Consider temporarily reducing rare probability to 7% until stock arrives

2. **Preventive:**
   - Set up auto-reorder trigger at 20 units
   - Maintain 2x buffer stock (if weekly burn = 10, keep 20+ in stock)

## FINAL NOTES

**Remember:**
1. This is a **test**, not a permanent commitment
2. You have a **rollback plan** ready
3. 30 days is enough to know if it works
4. Real data > projections
5. User feedback matters more than spreadsheets
6. If in doubt, ask the community

**Most important question to ask yourself weekly:**

> "If I had to decide right now whether to keep this distribution or revert, what would I choose and why?"

If the answer is "revert" for 2 weeks in a row, it's time to revert.
